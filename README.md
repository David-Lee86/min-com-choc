Controlled Cocoa Fermentation with Defined Microbes

Description
This repository contains analysis scripts and supporting materials related to the study of microbial communities involved in cocoa bean fermentation, both in field settings and under controlled in vitro conditions. The research investigates how a defined microbial consortium can replicate key characteristics of fine flavour cocoa fermentation.

This repository supports the publication:
A defined microbial community reproduces attributes of fine flavour chocolate fermentation.
